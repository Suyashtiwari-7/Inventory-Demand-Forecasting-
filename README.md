# Inventory Demand Forecasting 📦📈

A machine-learning project that forecasts product demand using historical sales data. Includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation to improve inventory planning. 🚀

## Key Features ✨
- Data preprocessing & cleaning 🧹
- Exploratory data analysis & visualization 🔍📊
- Feature engineering ⚙️
- Model training & evaluation 🧠🧪
- Performance metrics & comparison 📈
- Reproducible notebooks (Jupyter) 📓

## Getting Started 🛠️
1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suyashtiwari-7/Inventory-Demand-Forecasting-.git
cd Inventory-Demand-Forecasting-
```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebooks and run the steps in order: preprocessing → EDA → feature engineering → modeling. 🧭

## Repository Structure 🗂️
- notebooks/ - Jupyter notebooks for analysis and modeling 📓
- data/ - raw and processed datasets (if included) 📁
- models/ - trained model artifacts (if saved) 🧰
- README.md - project overview 📖

## Usage 💡
- Follow the notebooks to reproduce experiments and retrain models with your own data.
- Update hyperparameters in the modeling notebook to tune performance.

## Evaluation 📊
- Use standard metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) to evaluate forecasting accuracy.
- Compare multiple models to choose the best performer.
